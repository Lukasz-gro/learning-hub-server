  "description": "You have a tutoring company and you want to employ tutors but you do not know how many of them do you need. You must hire at least one tutor in the province. A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group (if city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c). If city a is directly connected with city b, then there is direct connection between city b and city a. The standard input will consist of two lines. The first line contains a two integer numbers n(1≤n≤200) and m(1≤m≤500), indicating the number of cities and the second line contains m pairs [i, j] (0≤i,j<n) indicating that there is direct connection between i-th and j-th city. Return the minimum number of tutors you need to hire so that there are at least one for each province. <span><strong>Example 1</strong></span> <br/><span><strong>Input:</strong></span> <br/>3 1 0 1<br/> <span><strong>Output:</strong></span> 2 <br/> <br/> <span><strong>Example 2</strong></span> <br/><span><strong>Input:</strong></span> <br/>3 2 0 1 1 2<br/> <span><strong>Output:</strong></span>  1 <br/> <br/> <span><strong>Example 3</strong></span> <br/><span><strong>Input:</strong></span> <br/>3 0<br/> <span><strong>Output:</strong></span> 3",
