The second line contains n integer numbers separated by spaces in range of 1 to 1000, each integer representing the exercise number performed by Janek.<br/>The program should return a single integer to the standard output, indicating the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of exercises that Janek will perform with a smile on his face. <br/><br/><span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Example 1</span><br/><span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Input:</span> <br/> 8 <br/> 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 2 <br/>\n        <span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Output:</span> 3\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        <span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Example 2</span><br/><span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Input:</span> <br/>5 <br/>  1 1 1 1 1<br/>\n        <span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Output:</span> 1<br/><br/><span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Example 3</span><br/><span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Input:</span> <br/> 6 <br/>  8 4 4 5 1 4<br/><span style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>Output:</span> 3",
