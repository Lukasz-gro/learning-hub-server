  "description": "Janek has started going to the gym, and in order to maximize his results, he consulted with a personal trainer who created a workout plan for him (each exercise is denoted by a natural number). However, Janek really dislikes performing the same exercises in sequence at the gym.<br/> Determine the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of exercises that Janek will perform without repetition during the given training session. The standard input will consist of two lines.<br/> The first line contains a single integer number n (1≤n≤1000000), indicating the number of exercises performed during the training session. The second line contains n integer numbers separated by spaces in range of 1 to 1000, each integer representing the exercise number performed by Janek. <br/>The program should return a single integer to the standard output, indicating the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of exercises that Janek will perform with a smile on his face. <br/> <br/> <span><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br/><span><strong>Input:</strong></span> <br/> 8 <br/> 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 2 <br/> <span><strong>Output:</strong></span> 3 <br/> <br/> <span><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br/><span><strong>Input:</strong></span> <br/>5 <br/>  1 1 1 1 1<br/> <span><strong>Output:</strong></span> 1 <br/> <br/> <span><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br/><span><strong>Input:</strong></span> <br/> 6 <br/>  8 4 4 5 1 4<br/> <span><strong>Output:</strong></span> 3",
